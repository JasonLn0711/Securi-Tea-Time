# 🍵 Securi-Tea-Time

**Securi-Tea-Time** is an intelligent, lightweight, real-time security system that detects people and vehicles from a Xiaomi C400 CCTV feed. It mirrors an iPhone camera feed via QuickTime on macOS and uses YOLOv8 for object detection, OCR for license plate recognition, and clothing-color-based person re-identification. Events are logged automatically, snapshots are saved, and LINE notifications are sent with image attachments.

🚀 Developed by a graduate student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), this project offers a plug-and-play solution for home, remote work, and small-business security—using just a phone and laptop.
