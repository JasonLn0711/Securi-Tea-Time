# Securi-Tea-Time
Securi-Tea Time is a smart security project that uses YOLO and OCR to detect people and vehicles from your CCTV feed (via QuickTime on macOS). It logs events, sends LINE notifications with snapshots, and even re-identifies persons based on clothing colors for automated home and parking security.
